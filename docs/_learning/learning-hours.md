A Learning Hour is a short, structured training session for software developers, led by experienced practitioners 
and focused on a specific learning goal. These sessions last about an hour and can be held remotely or in person, 
fitting into regular work schedules. Teams may hold them daily, weekly, or per sprint to gradually introduce new 
ideas and skills.
