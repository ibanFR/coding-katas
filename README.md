## What is a Coding Kata?
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice. A code kata is 
usually set up as a series of unit tests, which fail. Your task is to write code to make them pass. The idea is inspired
by the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. Just like in the martial arts, you can repeat a kata multiple times
to make improvements to your solutions.

## Testing framework
The exercises are tested using JUnit 5.
